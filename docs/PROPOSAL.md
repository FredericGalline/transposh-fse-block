# Transposh FSE Block - Plugin Integration Proposal

## Executive Summary

I've developed a Full Site Editing (FSE) compatible Gutenberg block for the Transposh plugin that provides all the functionality of the current language switcher widget in a modern, block-based interface.

## Why This Matters

WordPress is moving towards a block-first approach with FSE becoming the standard. Many users now expect block-based solutions, and this enhancement would:

- **Future-proof Transposh** for modern WordPress installations
- **Improve user experience** with visual, real-time editing
- **Expand compatibility** with block themes and site builders
- **Maintain existing functionality** while adding modern features

## What's Included

### ✅ Complete Block Implementation
- **3 display styles**: Horizontal, Vertical, Dropdown
- **All current features**: Flags, language names, edit translation mode
- **Advanced options**: Hide current language, nofollow attributes
- **Custom titles**: User-defined widget titles

### ✅ Developer-Ready
- **Production-ready code** following WordPress standards
- **Complete build system** with webpack and npm scripts
- **Multi-language support** with .po/.mo files included
- **Comprehensive documentation** and integration guides

### ✅ User Experience
- **WYSIWYG editor preview** (non-clickable to prevent navigation)
- **Real-time configuration** with instant visual feedback
- **Sidebar controls** matching WordPress admin interface
- **FSE compatibility** for site-wide language switching

## Technical Highlights

- **Server-side rendering** ensures compatibility with all Transposh features
- **Security-first approach** with input sanitization and permission checks
- **Graceful fallbacks** when plugin is not available
- **Zero breaking changes** - works alongside existing widgets

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Direct Plugin Integration
- Add the block to the next Transposh release
- Seamless user experience with single plugin install
- Native plugin support and maintenance

### Option 2: Companion Plugin
- Release as separate plugin that extends Transposh
- Faster release cycle for block updates
- Optional for users who prefer widgets

### Option 3: Community Contribution
- Add to WordPress plugin repository
- Community-driven development
- Wider adoption and testing

## Benefits for Transposh Users

1. **Modern editing experience** - Visual block editing
2. **FSE compatibility** - Works with block themes
3. **Site-wide placement** - Use in headers, footers, templates
4. **Real-time preview** - See changes instantly
5. **Consistent UI** - Matches WordPress admin interface

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Immediate): Code review and testing
- **Phase 2** (1-2 weeks): Integration and refinement
- **Phase 3** (Release): Documentation and user migration

## Support & Maintenance

I'm committed to:
- Ongoing support for integration process
- Bug fixes and compatibility updates
- Documentation maintenance
- Community support

## Next Steps

1. **Review the code** and test with your Transposh installation
2. **Discuss integration approach** that works best for your roadmap
3. **Plan release strategy** (major version, minor update, etc.)
4. **Coordinate documentation** and user communication

## Demo & Testing

The block is fully functional and ready for testing. I can provide:
- **Live demo** on a test site
- **Video walkthrough** of features
- **Integration consultation** call
- **Code review** session

## Contact
